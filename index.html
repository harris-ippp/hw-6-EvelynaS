  In October 1st, 2017, a gunman opened fire on a crowd
  of concertgoers at Harvest music festival on Las Vegas,
  Nevada, leaving 58 people dead and 546 injured.
  According with the investigation, the gunman had in his
  possession twenty-three firearms legally purchased in the
  states of Nevada, California, Texas and Utah.

This incident revived the public and political debate among
groups that support more strict regulation of gun sales and
defenders of the Second Amendment, that protects the right
of the american citizens to keep and bear arms.Guns control
debates have had historically an effect in the gun market.
 <b> <cite>
After San Bernardino shooting (Dec, 2015), Pulse attack (August,
2016) and the Paris terror attacks (Nov, 2015) gun stocks spiked
because people started to buy more guns either for defensive
motives or for the fear of that stricter regulations. </b> </cite>

    <p align="justify">
       The main idea of our research is to assess how an extreme event -a shooting- affects the discussion about
 the right to bear arms in U.S. We will perform a Sentiment Analysis in Twitter about the 2nd Amendment
 and assess if some significant changes occur in the aftermath of Las Vegas shooting.

It is evident that a gun massacre of this dimension makes people to feel more insecure but their reactions
can vary from wanting more gun controls (negative tweets increase more than positives) to be more likely
to buy a gun to defend themselves (positive tweets increase more than negatives). That technique allows to
determine whether that topic (2nd Amendment) is positive, negative or neutral.
